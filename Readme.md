# Basics [Algorithms](https://github.com/profileEnumerable/Implementation-algos-and-data-structures/tree/master/Algorithms) and [Data structures](https://github.com/profileEnumerable/Implementation-algos-and-data-structures/tree/master/Data%20structures) using C#


 This repository was created in order to implement a variety of algorithms and data structures that are the basic for programming. In addition to basic algorithms you will also see tasks from various sources that are directly related  with optimizing search and formatting of these data types :

 * Int
 * String

 In future will be added table with ranked by alg and data structures with their complexity.
